### Screeps AI
My second take on an AI for the programmer MMO Screeps (https://screeps.com/)

You can watch the AI in action over here: https://screeps.com/a/#!/profile/Jacudibu/, although you might need an account in order to see everything.

Learning from previous mistakes, this iteration will be completely autonomous right from the get go â€“ the goal is that I won't enter any non-diagnostic stuff into the console whatsoever, and treat the memory view as read-only. Let's see how well that goes!

#### Some other notes
Please do not copy this codebase and use it as your own on the public server.
